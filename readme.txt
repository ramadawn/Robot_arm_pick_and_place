I am submitting this as a way of requesting help for my project. I have tried to get help from the online chat box several times now and each time said help has let me no where.

I have managed to write code for the IK_server.py file that allows the the arm to calculate the trajectory to the object and the deposit item trajectory.

Unfortunately most of the time the arm simple smashes into the pick up object or (if it does pick up the item) fails to actually move to the deposit bin.

I am at a loss to figure out why this is happening and I hereby request help.

Thank you.
